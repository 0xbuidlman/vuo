Outputs smoothed values from the faders of a Behringer BCF2000 MIDI/USB control surface.

When the composition starts, and when the `Reset` port receives an event, this node outputs the default values for each fader, and sends MIDI messages to the BCF2000 to physically position its motorized faders.
