Outputs smoothed values from the foot controls of a Behringer BCF2000 MIDI/USB control surface.

When the composition starts, and when the `Reset` port receives an event, this node outputs the default values for each foot control, and sends MIDI messages to the BCF2000 to set each foot control's initial state.
