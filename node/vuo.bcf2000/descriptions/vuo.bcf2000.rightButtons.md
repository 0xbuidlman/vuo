Outputs smoothed values from the matrix of buttons on the right side of a Behringer BCF2000 MIDI/USB control surface.

When the composition starts, and when the `Reset` port receives an event, this node outputs the default values for each button, and sends MIDI messages to the BCF2000 to set each button's LED.
