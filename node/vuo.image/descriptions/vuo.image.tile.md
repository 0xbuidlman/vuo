Repeats an image by tiling it in a grid.

   - `Center` — The position in the output image at which the center 4 images' corners touch, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Width` — The size of each tiled image, in Vuo Coordinates.
   - `Reflect Odd Rows` — When true, odd-numbered rows (counting up from the center) are flipped, to produce a continuous image.  When false, each copy of the image is translated but not reflected.
   - `Reflect Odd Columns` — When true, odd-numbered columns (counting right from the center) are flipped, to produce a continuous image.  When false, each copy of the image is translated but not reflected.
