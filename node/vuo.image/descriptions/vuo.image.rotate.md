   - `image` — The image to rotate. 
   - `rotation` — The angle to rotate the image counterclockwise, in degrees. 
   - `expandBounds` — If false, the output image will have the same width and height as the input image, and the corners of the rotated image will be cropped to fit. If true, the output image will have width and height large enough to contain the entire rotated image.
