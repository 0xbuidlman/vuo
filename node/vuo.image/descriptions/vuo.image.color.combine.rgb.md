Combines red, green, and blue channels into a single image.

Each color in a computer image is represented as a combination of [red, green, and blue components](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model). For example, a pale pink color is made up of equal measures of red and blue, plus a little green.

This node uses the input images as the red, green, and blue components of the output image.  The brighter (closer to white) an area of an input image, the stronger that color component will be in the output image.  The output image's opacity (alpha channel) is the average of the input images'.
