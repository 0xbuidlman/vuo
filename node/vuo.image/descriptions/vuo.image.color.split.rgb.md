Splits the image into its red, green, and blue channels.

Each color in a computer image is represented as a combination of [red, green, and blue components](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model). For example, a pale pink color is made up of equal measures of red and blue, plus a little green.

This node outputs a grayscale image for each of the red, green, and blue components of the input image.  The lighter shades of gray in each output image correspond to areas where that color component was strongest in the input image.  The output image's opacity (alpha channel) is copied from the input image.
