These nodes are for working with 2D images. 

In **Vuo coordinates**, (0,0) is the center of an image. An image has a width of 2, with x-coordinate -1 on the left edge and 1 on the right edge. An image's height is determined by its aspect ratio, with the y-coordinate increasing from bottom to top.

To use a 2D image in 3D space, you can use the `Make 3D Object from Image` in the `vuo.scene` node set.
