Renders an image containing the specified text.

   - `text` — The text to render.
   - `font` — The font used to render the text.  See also the `Make Font` node.
   - `image` — The image containing the rendered text.  The image is automatically sized to fit the specified text.

To render an image that has text on multiple lines (text that contains line breaks), compose your text in a basic text editor (such as TextEdit) and copy and paste it into the `text` port's input editor.
