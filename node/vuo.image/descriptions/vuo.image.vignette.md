Darkens the image around the edges. 

The darkened area forms an oval frame around the image, fading from the original image to black. 

   - `width` — The width of the oval, in Vuo coordinates. (The height is calculated from the image's aspect ratio.) 
   - `sharpness` — How sharp the edge of the oval is. A value of 0 means the transition to black is very gradual; a value of 1 means the transition is immediate.
