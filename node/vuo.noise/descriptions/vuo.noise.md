These nodes provide different ways of generating random numbers. 

**Gradient noise** (including **Perlin noise** and **simplex noise**) is useful for creating natural-looking movement and textures. 

**Uniformly distributed** random numbers are useful for picking from a set of options. When a random number is generated from a uniform distribution, the number falls between a given minimum and maximum. Each number between the minimum and the maximum has an equal chance of being picked.
