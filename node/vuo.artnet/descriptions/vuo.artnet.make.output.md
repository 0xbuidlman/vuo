Connect this node to `Send Art-Net Messages` to dynamically choose an Art-Net Port-Address to broadcast to.

Unlike the `Make Art-Net IP Output` node, this node sends to all devices on the network.

The `Net`, `Sub-Net`, and `Universe` collectively specify the Port-Address to which DMX frames should be directed. An individual DMX frame consists of 512 channels of lighting intensity information.
