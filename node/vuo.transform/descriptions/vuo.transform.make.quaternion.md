Creates a transform that can change a 3D object's position, rotation, or size.

   - `translation` — The amount to shift the object's position, in Vuo coordinates. If this is (0,0,0), the position will be unchanged.
   - `rotation` — The amount to rotate the object, as a quaternion.
   - `scale` — The scale factor. If this is (1,1,1), the object's size will be unchanged.
