Creates a mesh in the shape of a sphere.

The sphere has a diameter of 1 and is centered at (0,0,0).

The sphere has vertices along its latitude (row) and longitude (column) lines. `rows` and `columns` are the number of latitude and longitude lines. With more rows and columns, the sphere has a rounder shape but may take longer to render.
