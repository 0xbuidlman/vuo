These nodes are for capturing input from a mouse or touchpad. 

Your starting point is the `Get Mouse` node, which tracks mouse movements, button actions, and scrolling. 

If you only want to track the mouse or touchpad for a specific window, use the `Render Scene to Window` node in the `vuo.scene` node set.
