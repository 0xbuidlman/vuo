Fires an event when the mouse is scrolled. 

   - `Modifier Key` — The keyboard button (if any) that must be held for the mouse action to be tracked. 
   - `Scrolled` — When the mouse is scrolled, fires an event with the distance scrolled. This is the change in position since the previous `Scrolled` event. The vertical distance (y-coordinate) respects the operating system's "natural scrolling" setting.
