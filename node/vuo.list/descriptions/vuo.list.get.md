Selects one item from a list.

`Which` is the number of the item to pick (1 for the first item, 2 for the second item, etc.). If `Which` is less than 1, the first item is picked. If `Which` is greater than the list size, the last item is picked.

If the list doesn't contain any items, outputs a zero or empty value (for example, an empty image or blank text).
