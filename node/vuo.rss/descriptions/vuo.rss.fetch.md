Loads or downloads an RSS feed from a URL.

   - `URL` — The URL of an RSS feed.
   - `Fetch Images` — Whether to load or download an image associated with each feed item.  Depending on the connection speed and quantity and size of the images, this can take a substantial amount of time.

To download a feed from the internet, copy the feed's URL from your browser. Example: 

   - `https://vuo.org/composition/feed`

To load a feed from a file on the computer running the composition, create a URL from the file's path. Examples: 

   - `file:///Library/Feeds/example.rss`
   - `/Library/Feeds/example.rss`
   - `example.rss` (for a file called "example.rss" in the same folder as the composition)
   - `feeds/example.rss` (for a file called "example.rss" in a folder called "feeds" in the same folder as the composition)
