Applies a different image compositing style to the layer.

By default, Vuo blends layers by drawing foreground pixels solidly in front of background pixels â€” if foreground pixels are fully opaque, they will fully obscure background pixels.  This node allows changing the blending so that the resulting color takes into account both the foreground and background pixels' color.
