   - `image` — The image displayed in the layer. For the layer to be visible, you have to provide an image. 
   - `center` — The center point of the image, in Vuo coordinates. 
   - `rotation` — The image's rotation to the left, in degrees. 
   - `width` — The image's width, in Vuo coordinates. Its height is determined by the image's aspect ratio. 
   - `alpha` — The image's opacity, from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).
