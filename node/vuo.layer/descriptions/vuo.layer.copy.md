Creates a list of layers consisting of transformed copies of an original.

This node is useful for displaying multiple similar layers within a scene.

   - `layer` — The original layer.
   - `transforms` — The translation, rotation, and scale of each copy.
   - `copies` — A list of layers, one for each item in (and in the same order as) `transforms`.
