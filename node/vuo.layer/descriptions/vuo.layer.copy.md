Creates multiple layers consisting of transformed copies of an original.

This node is useful for displaying multiple similar layers within a scene.

   - `Layer` — The original layer.
   - `Transforms` — The translation, rotation, and scale of each copy.
   - `Copies` — A layer group containing the layer copies, one for each item in (and in the same order as) `Transforms`.
