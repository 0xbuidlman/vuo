   - `Center` — The center point of the oval, in Vuo coordinates. 
   - `Rotation` — The oval's rotation counterclockwise, in degrees. 
   - `Width` — The width of the oval, in Vuo coordinates.
   - `Height` — The height of the oval, in Vuo coordinates.
   - `Sharpness` — How sharp the edge of the oval is.  A value of 0 means the edge is blurry; a value of 1 means the edge is sharp.
