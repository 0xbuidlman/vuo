Groups multiple layers together and applies a transformation to the group. 

   - `transform` — A transform that changes the layer's translation, rotation, or scale. It should use Vuo coordinates. 
   - `layers` — The layers to put into a group. When the layers are rendered, they're placed on top of each other in the order listed, with the first layer on the bottom and the last layer on the top.
