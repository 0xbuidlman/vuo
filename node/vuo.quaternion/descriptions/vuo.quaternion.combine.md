Finds the rotation that would result after rotating by each of the values.

If there are no values, outputs the identity quaternion (no rotation). 

The rotations are performed in the order of the values (rotation by the first quaternion, followed by rotation by the second quaternion, etc.).

The output is a unit (normalized) quaternion.
