Finds the rotation that would result after rotating by each of the terms.

If there are no terms, outputs the identity quaternion (no rotation). 

The rotations are performed in the order of the terms (rotation by the first quaternion, followed by rotation by the second quaternion, etc.).

The output is a unit (normalized) quaternion.
