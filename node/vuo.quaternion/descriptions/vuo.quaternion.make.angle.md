Calculates a quaternion that represents a rotation in 3D space.

   - `axis` — A point in 3D space. Only its direction from the origin matters; its magnitude (distance from the origin) is not important.
   - `angle` — The angle of rotation about the axis, in degrees.
   - `quaternion` — A unit (normalized) quaternion.
