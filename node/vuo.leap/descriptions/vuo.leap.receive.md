Fires an event each time the Leap Motion device provides new hand- and finger-tracking data.

This node is only compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 and up.

If this node is not firing events, but your Leap device is plugged in:

- Check that your Leap service is running (the Leap service bar in the top right toolbar should be green).
- Make sure your Leap Motion application is up to date - Vuo requires version 2.0.5 or greater in order to operate properly (at the time of writing, Leap 2.0 is in a public beta.  Download available here: [Leap v2 SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/) ).
