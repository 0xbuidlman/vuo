Approximates the perceived loudness of the audio samples. 

An audio sample measures the amplitude of sound. Humans perceive the loudness of sound based on a complicated set of factors that includes amplitude. This node provides a rough approximation of the perceived loudness (by calculating the root mean square of the samples). 

The output is typically a number between 0 and 1.
