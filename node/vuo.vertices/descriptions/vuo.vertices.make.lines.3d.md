Creates a set of vertices that form line segments. 

   - `positions` â€” A list of the endpoints of the line segments. The 1st point and 2nd point are endpoints for one line segment, the 3rd point and 4th point are endpoints for another line segment, and so on. 

Even if the line segments connect to form a 2D or 3D object, they're rendered simply as line segments, not as a solid object.
