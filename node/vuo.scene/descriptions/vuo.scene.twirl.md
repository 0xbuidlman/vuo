Rotates part of the object, while holding part of it steady.

This node moves the object's vertices toward a circular path.  The further above or below the ground (XZ) plane the vertices are, the more they are moved.

   - `amount` â€” The angle, in degrees, to rotate the vertices at y=1 and y=-1.  Vertices closer to y=0 are bent less; vertices further out are bent more.
