Rotates part of the object, while holding part of it steady.

This node moves the object's vertices toward a circular path.  The further above or below the ground (XZ) plane the vertices are, the more they are moved.

   - `Amount` â€” The angle, in degrees, to rotate the vertices at Y=1 and Y=-1.  Vertices closer to Y=0 are bent less; vertices further out are bent more.
