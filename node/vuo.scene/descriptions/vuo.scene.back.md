Shows the back/interior of the object (optionally keeping the front/exterior).

By default, Vuo only renders the front side of an object.  For example, with `Make Sphere Vertices`, Vuo shows the sphere when viewed from the outside — but if you move the camera inside the sphere, it disappears.  This node allows viewing objects from behind or inside.

   - `keepFront` — If enabled, the object will be visible from both the front/exterior and back/interior.
