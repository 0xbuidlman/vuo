Sharpens the object's edges.

This node takes each trianglar face in the object's mesh, and changes its normals so that they all point the same direction: the average of each vertex's normals.  This causes smooth edges to appear sharp.

This node only affects triangle meshes; it has no effect on point and line meshes.
