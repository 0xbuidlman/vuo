Turns an image into a 3D object that can be added to a 3D scene. 

The 3D object is like a piece of paper that displays the image on one side.

   - `center` — The center point of the 3D object, in Vuo coordinates.
   - `rotation` — The rotation of the 3D object, in degrees (Euler angles). At (0,0,0), the image is facing front.
   - `width` — The width of the 3D object, in Vuo coordinates. The height is calculated from the width to preserve the image's aspect ratio.
