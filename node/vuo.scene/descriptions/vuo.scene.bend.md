Warps the object along a curve.

This node moves the object's vertices toward a circular path.  The further above or below the X axis the vertices are, the more they are moved.

   - `amount` — The angle, in degrees, to bend the vertices at y=1 and y=-1.  Vertices closer to y=0 are bent less; vertices further out are bent more.
   - `radius` — The radius of the circular path along which to bend the object.
   - `direction` — The angle, in degrees about the Y axis, of the plane along which the vertices are bent.
