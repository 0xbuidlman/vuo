Pulls the object toward the specified point, or pushes it away from the point.

This node warps the object using a classic gravitational force, where the force is proportional to the square of the distance.

   - `Amount` — How strongly to push or pull the object.  When 0, the object is unaffected.  When positive, the object is pulled toward the center point.  When negative, the object is pushed away.
   - `Center` — The center of the gravitational force that attracts or repels the object.
