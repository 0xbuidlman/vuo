Creates 3D object group consisting of transformed copies of an original.

This node is useful for displaying multiple similar 3D objects within a scene.

   - `Object` — The original 3D object.
   - `Transforms` — The translation, rotation, and scale of each copy.
   - `Copies` — A group of 3D objects, one for each item in (and in the same order as) `Transforms`.
