Creates a list of 3D objects consisting of transformed copies of an original.

This node is useful for displaying multiple similar 3D objects within a scene.

   - `object` — The original 3D object.
   - `transforms` — The translation, rotation, and scale of each copy.
   - `copies` — A list of 3D objects, one for each item in (and in the same order as) `transforms`.
