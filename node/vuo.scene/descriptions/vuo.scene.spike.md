This node takes every triangle in an object and splits it into 3 triangles, each touching a new vertex added at the center of the original triangle.

   - `distance` â€” The amount to move the new vertex outward relative to the plane of the original triangle.

This node only affects triangle meshes; it has no effect on point and line meshes.
