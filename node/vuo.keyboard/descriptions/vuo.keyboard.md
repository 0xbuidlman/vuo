These nodes are for capturing input from the keyboard. 

The composition must have at least one window for these nodes to output any keyboard information. 

These nodes can be used either to provide keyboard controls for a composition (for example, making the arrow keys move a game avatar) or to receive text typed. If providing keyboard controls, then typically you'd want the `Receive Keyboard Buttons` node. If receiving text typed, then typically you'd want the `Receive Keyboard Typing` node.
